Welcome to my website! I﻿'m pursuing an M.S. in Statistics at the University of Chicago. Prior to my graduate studies, I received my B.S. in Statistics and Financial Mathematics from the University of Toronto. 

I﻿'m broadly interested in Bayesian and Computational Statistics, Machine Learning, and their applications in Finance. Currently, I'm working with [Prof. Dacheng Xiu](https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/) and [Prof. Per Mykland](https://galton.uchicago.edu/~mykland/) on projects leveraging intraday high-frequency financial data and ML.

During my undergrad at UofT, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Radu Craiu](https://utstat.toronto.edu/craiu/) and [Prof. Scott Schwartz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-schwartz-phd-b2527212a/?originalSubdomain=se) with whom I conducted research in Approximate Bayesian Computation(ABC) and Bayesian Deep Learning(BDL), respectively.
